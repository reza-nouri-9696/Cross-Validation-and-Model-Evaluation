# Cross-Validation-and-Model-Evaluation
This repository contains Python scripts for creating cross-validation folds (`create_fold.py`) and running logistic regression models on each fold, evaluating the model's performance (`run.py`).

## Cross-Validation

### create_fold.py

The `create_fold.py` script generates cross-validation folds for your dataset using Stratified K-Folds. The folds are added as a new column (`kfold`) in the CSV file.

#### Usage
''' bash
python create_fold.py --input <path-to-input-csv> --output <path-to-output-csv-with-folds>
''
##Model Evaluation
run.py
The run.py script reads the CSV file with cross-validation folds, preprocesses the data, trains logistic regression models on each fold, and evaluates the model's performance using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. It also generates confusion matrices and AUC graphs.

Usage
  ```bash
python run.py --input <path-to-input-csv-with-folds>
Usage
Run create_fold.py to create cross-validation folds.
  ```bash
Copy code
python create_fold.py --input <path-to-input-csv> --output <path-to-output-csv-with-folds>
Run run.py to train logistic regression models on each fold and evaluate performance.
  ```bash
Copy code
python run.py --input <path-to-input-csv-with-folds>
## Results

The results of the model evaluation process include the following visualizations, saved as PNG files in the current working directory:

### Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](confusion_matrix.png)

This matrix provides an overview of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the logistic regression model on each fold.

### Normalized Confusion Matrix

![Normalized Confusion Matrix](normalized_confusion_matrix.png)

The normalized confusion matrix presents the proportion of correct predictions relative to the actual class distribution.

### AUC Graph

![AUC Graph](auc_graph.png)

The Area Under the Curve (AUC) graph illustrates the model's performance across each fold, providing insights into the discriminatory power of the logistic regression classifier.

Feel free to explore these visualizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior on the cross-validation folds.

ok now write that on readme format while dont need I change any thing
