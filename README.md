## Cross-Validation

### create_fold.py

The `create_fold.py` script generates cross-validation folds for your dataset using Stratified K-Folds. The folds are added as a new column (`kfold`) in the CSV file.

#### Usage

  ```bash
python create_fold.py --input <path-to-input-csv> --output <path-to-output-csv-with-folds>

Model Evaluation
run.py
The run.py script reads the CSV file with cross-validation folds, preprocesses the data, trains logistic regression models on each fold, and evaluates the model's performance using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. It also generates confusion matrices and AUC graphs.

Usage
bash
Copy code
python run.py --input <path-to-input-csv-with-folds>
Usage
Run create_fold.py to create cross-validation folds.
bash
Copy code
python create_fold.py --input <path-to-input-csv> --output <path-to-output-csv-with-folds>
Run run.py to train logistic regression models on each fold and evaluate performance.
bash
Copy code
python run.py --input <path-to-input-csv-with-folds>
Results
The results include confusion matrices, normalized confusion matrices, and an AUC graph for each fold. Figures are saved as PNG files in the current working directory.

ok now write that on readme format while dont need I change any thing

Certainly! Below is a README file content formatted for your create_fold.py and run.py scripts. You can copy and paste this content into a README.md file in your GitHub repository.
